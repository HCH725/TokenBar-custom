/// have to apply the same fold themselves or they disagree with the Models
/// view. This mirrors the engine's one built-in rule (`builtin_grouping` in
/// `vendor/tokscale-core/src/model_alias.rs`): Grok Build keys turn usage by
/// `grok-<version>-build` while the session names `grok-<version>` (#118).

/// Presentation only. Anything that matches a model id — quota scopes and
/// attribution records — keeps the raw id. `ModelColorMap` groups on both
/// sides, construction and lookup, so a raw entry and a raw lookup still meet
/// and the two ids share one shade. `Tests/fixtures/model-grouping-cases.json` is checked against both
/// this function (SelfTest) and the engine (tb_core_ffi test). That binds the
/// two on those inputs only: an engine rule that widens beyond the table, or
/// a user alias map once the app installs one, would not be caught by it.
